This is an R Markdown document for OMOP Completeness Test. This test is written to function on ROSITA-ready .txt files. 

To run the test:
1. Clone the entire repository on your computer.
2. Open `Comp_prep.R` in R Studio
3. In `Comp_prep.R`, set the working directory to the same directory that you have cloned these tiles
```{r, echo=FALSE}
setwd("~/...")
```
4. Make sure to install packages. Once you've installed them, you can comment out `install.packages(packages, dependencies = TRUE)`
5. In `Comp_prep.R`, set "path" to the directory that contains ROSITA-ready .txt files
***NOTE: if your OMOP files are in another format, you'll have to define the right parameters (header, sep, quote, fill, etc.) in `read.table`
```{r, echo=FALSE}
for (i in 1:length(filenames)) assign(filenames[i], 
                                      read.table(paste(path,"/",filenames[i],sep=""), header = T, sep="|",quote = "",fill = TRUE))

```
6. After making these adjustments to the `Comp_prep.R`, run `Comp_test.R`.
