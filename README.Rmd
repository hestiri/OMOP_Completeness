This is an R Markdown document for OMOP Completeness Test. 

I am going to embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

I am going to also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
